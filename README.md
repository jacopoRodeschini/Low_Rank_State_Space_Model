## Article Abstract
This paper proposes a novel low-rank approximation to the multivariate State-Space Model. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach is applied component-wise to the independent-in-time Mat√©rn Gaussian innovation term in the latent equation, assuming component independence. This results in a sparse representation of the latent process on a finite element mesh, allowing for scalable inference through sparse matrix operations. Dependencies among observed components are introduced through a matrix of weights applied to the latent process. Model parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm, which features closed-form updates for most parameters and efficient numerical routines for the remaining parameters. We prove theoretical results regarding the accuracy and convergence of the SPDE-based approximation under fixed-domain asymptotics. Simulation studies show our theoretical results. We include an empirical application on air quality to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed model, which maintains computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings. In this application, we reduce computation time by about 93\%, with only a 15\% increase in the validation error.


## Contents


* **`main.py`**: Runs the simulation to confirm theoretical findings. Results are saved in the `output/` folder.  

* **`case_study.py`**: Runs the case study application.  

* **`utils/`**: Module containing utility functions.  

* **`output/`**: Stores simulation results.  

* **`shapefile/`**: Folder with the Italian shapefile required for the case study.  

* **`environment.txt`**: List of Python packages required to create the conda environment.  



## Run the simulation and setup Instructions

1. **Download the repository** as a ZIP file named `Low_Rank_State_Space_Model.zip`, and extract it into a folder named `Low_Rank_State_Space_Model`.

2. **Navigate into the folder**:

```bash
cd Low_Rank_State_Space_Model
```

3. **Create the Conda environment** (named `dev`) from the list of required packages:

```bash
conda create --name dev --file environment.txt
```

4. **Activate the environment**:

```bash
conda activate dev
```

5. **Run the `main.py` script**:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Run the Case Study Application (AQCLIM_GRINS Dataset)

1. **Extract the dataset** (`.csv`) from empirical_application.zip. It comes from the Zenodo repository: [GRINS_AQCLIM_points_Italy.rda](https://zenodo.org/records/15699806/files/GRINS_AQCLIM_points_Italy.rda?download=1). 

2. **Activate the environment**:

```bash
conda activate dev
```

3. **Run the case study** using the Python script. The script requires the **low-rank parameter** as a command-line argument (e.g., `0.75`):

```bash
python case_study.py 0.75
```
