## Article Abstract
This paper proposes a novel low-rank approximation to the multivariate State-Space Model. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach is applied component-wise to the independent-in-time Mat√©rn Gaussian innovation term in the latent equation, assuming component independence. This results in a sparse representation of the latent process on a finite element mesh, allowing for scalable inference through sparse matrix operations. Dependencies among observed components are introduced through a matrix of weights applied to the latent process. Model parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm, which features closed-form updates for most parameters and efficient numerical routines for the remaining parameters. We prove theoretical results regarding the accuracy and convergence of the SPDE-based approximation under fixed-domain asymptotics. Simulation studies show our theoretical results. We include an empirical application on air quality to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed model, which maintains computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings. In this application, we reduce computation time by about 93\%, with only a 15\% increase in the validation error.
